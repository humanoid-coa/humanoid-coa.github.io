# Humanoid COA

This is the repository that contains the webpage for the Humanoid Agent via Embodied Chain-of-Action Reasoning with Multimodal Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Loco-Manipulation project.

## Project Overview

Humanoid-COA focuses on developing the first humanoid agent framework that integrates foundation model reasoning with an Embodied Chain-of-Action (CoA) mechanism for zero-shot loco-manipulation. The project combines cutting-edge research in:

- **Foundation Models**: Multimodal representations and reasoning capabilities
- **Chain-of-Action Reasoning**: Decomposing high-level instructions into structured action sequences
- **Loco-Manipulation**: Integrating whole-body locomotion with dexterous manipulation
- **Zero-Shot Learning**: Generalization to long-horizon and unstructured scenarios

## Website Structure

The website follows an academic paper format with the following sections:

- **Hero Section**: Project title, authors, and key links
- **Video**: Demonstration videos of the system in action
- **Abstract**: Project overview and key contributions
- **Methodology**: Technical approach and system architecture
- **System Architecture**: Detailed breakdown of system components
- **Assembly Tasks**: Various assembly scenarios and demonstrations
